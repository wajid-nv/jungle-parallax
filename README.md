# Jungle | Parallax scrolling website

When I was bored with coding, I just found an interesting video in youtube and I just followed up it and finally made this.

_Video referred : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgk_2d4lhm8_

The process was very complex at end even though the beginning was interesting.

#### I used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

**I learned many new things. That are**

#### CSS

```css
section::before {
  content: "";
}

section img {
  object-fit: cover;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

#### Javascript

```javascript
window.addEventListener();
window.scrollY;
```

**Another thing is, this website is not responsive well**

It was just copying code from youtube video. But after coding, I figured out all new things used in it.

**_Visit the site, scroll and have fun :)_**
